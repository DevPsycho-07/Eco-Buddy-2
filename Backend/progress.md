✅ **Services Layer Complete - February 16, 2026**
- All 12 services implemented and registered in DI container
- Complete separation of business logic from controllers (Clean Architecture)
- All 7 controllers refactored to use service delegation:
  1. **ActivitiesController** - Delegating to ActivityService
  2. **AnalyticsController** - Delegating to AnalyticsService
  3. **TravelController** - Delegating to TravelService
  4. **UsersController** - Delegating to UserService, GoalService, DailyScoreService, NotificationService
  5. **PredictionsController** - Delegating to PredictionService
  6. **AchievementsController** - Delegating to AchievementService (extended with query methods)
  7. **NotificationsController** - Already using NotificationService
- Controllers now thin: parse userId from claims, call service, return HTTP response
- Services handle all business logic, data access, DTOs, validation
- Full test coverage maintained: 159/159 tests passing after refactoring
- Build verified: 0 errors
